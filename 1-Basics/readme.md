# Clean Code Basics

## What is Clean Code ?

A sign of **Bad/Dirty Code** is the code that you need to read multiple times to be able to understand it.

The code should be readable and understandable.

Clean code **is not about whether code works**. **It is about writing code easy to understand.**

A vast majority of the developer's time is spent reading and understanding code. Reading other people's code in order to add a new feature, solve a bug.

It is totally possible to write code that works but that is dirty and hard to understand. On the other hand, it is also totally possible to write code that works and that is easy to read and maintain. The second options is the best approach.

There are entire projects that die because they are difficult to maintain and understand.

Code:

- Should be **readable and meaningful.**

- Should **reduce cognitive load** while reading it.

- Should be **concise** and "to the point".

- Should **avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting** and **big code blocks**.

- Should follow **common best practices** and patterns.

- Should be **fun to write and to maintain**.

Clean code is easy to understand, dirty code is not easy to understand.

> You should write your code as a good writer / storyteller.

Think about you code as an easy, you are the author of your code. Write it such that it's fun and easy to read and understand !

## Key Pain Point

Places where the code can be hard to read, key pain points:

- Names of : Variables, Functions, Classes

- Structure & Comments : Code Formatting, good & band comments

- Functions: Length of the Functions, Number of Parameters.

- Conditionals & Error Handling: Deep Nesting, Missing Error Handling.

- Classes & Data Structures: Missing distinction between classes and data structures, Bloated Classes.

Solutions to write cleaner code:

Rules & Concepts
Patterns & Principles
Test-Driven Development
